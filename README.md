# Block Tales (Roblox)

## Notes
- This game is not yet finished, as it's still receiving new updates. Everything is subject to being balanced, changed, and more as the game is developed!

## Goal(s)
- Beat the Game (all Chapters up to the latest version. Demo 4 is releasing later this week, so development will likely begin when it comes out. Either that, or I may begin working on the game early so that I can get to work on Demo 4 as soon as possible.)
- Beat a Specific Chapter (selectable via YAML option)

## Items
- Cards (Useful/Progression)
- Important Things (Progression)
- Consumables (Filler/Useful)
- TIX (Filler)
- BUX (Progression for Shopsanity)

## Checks
- Collecting Important Things
- Collecting Cards
- Collecting BUX
- Beating Bosses
- Defeating Unique Enemies

## Options
- Remove Post-Goal Checks: A setting that allows the Player to remove any Checks in Chapters that are found after their Goal.
- Shopsanity: Each item in Shops is a Check.
- Levelsanity: Each Level Up is a Check. (The level cap for each Chapter would be logically accounted for.)
- Fishsanity: Each of the fish that can be caught in the Meadows Fishing Spot is a Check.
